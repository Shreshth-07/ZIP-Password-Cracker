Should you have any doubt about the ZipFile_Cracker.exe software integrity,
Use an anti virus scanner first to scan the zipped file
or
upload it to an online virus scanner of your choice and compare the checksums and file size of the zipped folder.

Also you should compare SHA256 checksums.

For all other questions see the github page where this project will be updated and maintained.
